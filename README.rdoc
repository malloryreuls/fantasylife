== FantasyLife

FantasyLife is a new spin on fantasy sports. The draft starts in October and each player is allowed to pick one sports team from each of the major sports leagues. The next iteration will include additional categories such as actor, actress, country, and company. This idea belongs to Corey Shepardson and was built by Mallory Reulman.
